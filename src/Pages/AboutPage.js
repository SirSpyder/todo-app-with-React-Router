//im going to use this page to comment in all the things i have tried to fix this project and what i think could of went wrong but not 100percent Was on track for full completion 
//logged off one day and log in the next to work on it again and it send back null and i have not been able to fix it even tho nothing should of changed while i was not online.
//so after trying force audit it only went from a few bad errors to over 100 so that did not help so went back to before that still no fix. 
// so then maybe its corrupted so i cloned and copied the work over to a fresh folder and still did not help once i installed the dependences its still would not work and had the same errors as before.
// alright so then i tried to downgrade to a version that might be more stable mabye the branch im on is 2 new did that and everytime i downloaded dependecies it still made it the hightes version even tho i went into json and set it to a lower version.
// another possible issue is maybe i messed up a hook possible i didnt catch that
// i might also have something conflicting with all the things im using im using css bootstrap mockapi and acilos and react router and react or im missing somthing i need. 
// i have removed and readded all dependices multiple times still to no avail 
// while time is running short ill just try and complete as much objectives for this that i can 
// another thing i check was to see if i had a miss match for version for react and react router they where both the same version so it cant be that.
// i worry it dude to swapping or cloning that maybe somehow i have multiple reacts and its bricking the whole assignment
// another challange i faced is trying to hit the 10 components goal and idk if pages counted for this or not so i went with the safe option but i was running out of ideas.
